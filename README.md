# FivePD-controller-fix
An old project, where I helped disable buttons on the controller, when people use the FivePD resource for FiveM

# Installation
1. Extract "controls.lua" into your main FivePD folder (see example: https://i.imgur.com/3U7Rq2r.png).
2. In your "__resource.lua" file, add >>   'controls.lua',   << to the top of the "client_scripts" brackets (see example: https://i.imgur.com/PZuIC2B.png).
a. Ensure you copy and paste the   ^^   above   ^^ - you have to include the quotations AND the comma.
3. Restart your server.
